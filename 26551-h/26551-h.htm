<p><small>[Substance of an address before a meeting of librarians held under the auspices of the Library
Organizer of the Ohio Library Commission, Ohio State University, October 8, 1909.]</small></p>

<p>The problem of government publications in the small libraries has
been discussed at much length by librarians, but it is still far from a
definite solution. In fact, there can be no general settlement of many
phases of this question, for each and every library must decide what its
own policy and attitude shall be toward this class of publications.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that some libraries ought to have all the
publications that are made for distribution, and therefore a system of
depository libraries is maintained by the government. The libraries
which are not favored with this privilege are compelled to make a selection
from the great number of documents and there is the essence of
the problem for discussion here. The question of what to get involves
the selection of certain publications which will be useful to present
patrons of the library and the acquisition of those for which a demand
can be created. For instance, if the library is located in a rural section,
there will be a big demand for publications relating to agriculture, and
a larger proportion of such documents will be secured than for other
subjects. If the students of the high school are interested in debating
present day questions, the publications of the government relating to
the existing political and economic conditions will be in demand.
In the final analysis, the librarian must feel the pulse of the community,
as it were, and secure the classes of government material which correspond
most nearly to the demand. At the same time, by making
use of bibliographies, of department lists of publications and of the reference
section in the Documents Office, the demand for this class of literature
can be materially increased and documents secured which are
not already in the library.</p>

<p>The purpose of this discussion is to suggest a list of government
publications which will be of use in a small library. Before doing so,
the various methods of securing documents must be mentioned, as the
way will be indicated with each document serial in the following list.
First of all, there is the system of depository distribution which is based
on the act of January 12, 1895. The idea is to place in all sections of
the country complete collections of all public documents which are
printed and made for distribution. This privilege is granted by law
or through the request of senators and representatives. The second
way in which large numbers of documents are distributed is through
the congressional quota. This practice is a very old one, being used
for the first time in 1791. Each member of Congress is given a quota
of all documents published by that body, the number varying with
each document. These are distributed by the order of the congressmen
and are sent out under their franks. As a rule, the libraries will receive
very prompt and courteous attention from their representative in Congress
to any request made for publications. Thirdly, the departments
and bureaus have mailing lists including public officials, institutions of
various kinds and interested people. Usually a request by a library
to be placed upon such a list is granted; if not, a letter to the congressman
will bring the desired result. Finally, the Superintendent of Documents
is authorized to sell the government publications at a price sufficient
to cover the actual expense of paper, press work and binding.
The amount is always small because the main costs of typesetting and
stereotyping are eliminated from the price. There are some publications
which are secured by sale only, this rule applying to libraries as
well as to individuals.</p>

<p>The list of publications which will be useful is as follows: The
<i>Farmers' Bulletins</i> of the Department of Agriculture are brief popular
articles which give in simple, concise language the results of investigations
and experiments. They also outline methods for farm procedure
and offer instructions and suggestions for the practical farmer.
The annual edition of these bulletins is over six and one half million
copies. By law eighty per cent. of these are placed at the disposal of
the members of Congress, the remaining twenty per cent. being in the
hands of the Secretary of Agriculture. Libraries will be placed on the
mailing list, or single copies will be sent on application to a senator,
representative or delegate, or to the secretary of the department. An
<i>Index to Farmers' Bulletins 1-250</i> was issued as <i>Bulletin 8</i> of the Division
of Publications, Department of Agriculture; <i>Circular No. 4</i> of this
Division is a <i>Farmers' Bulletin Subject Index</i>, and contains a list of the
subjects of the <i>Bulletins</i> arranged alphabetically. It is revised at
frequent intervals. The Library of Congress issues printed cards for
the <i>Farmers' Bulletins</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Yearbook</i> of the Department of Agriculture is virtually an
annual encyclopedia of popular, timely articles on special topics covering
the year's work of the Department and the year's progress in agriculture.
The law provides for an edition of 500,000 copies, but under
the new system of public printing, the actual number issued is 300,000.
The Department has 30,000 and the remainder is placed at the order of
the members of Congress. Applications to either source will be filled,
but requests had better be sent to the congressmen first. Two indexes
to the <i>Yearbook</i> have been prepared: <i>Bulletin 7</i>, Division of Publications
covers the annual volumes for the period, 1894-1900, and <i>Bulletin 9</i>
of the same Division, the years 1901-1905. Catalog cards for all the
articles can be secured from the Library of Congress.</p>

<p>The Division of Publications, Department of Agriculture, issues
<i>Circular No. 2</i>, <i>Publications for Free Distribution</i>, which gives the titles
of such publications. They are sent free as long as the edition lasts,
application being made to the Secretary of Agriculture. <i>Circular No. 3</i> is

<i>Publications for Sale</i>. These can be purchased from the Superintendent
of Documents, the remittances being sent by postal money orders, express
orders, New York draft, or in currency, but never in stamps.
There is also a <i>Monthly List of Publications</i> issued by the Department of
Agriculture, which will be sent to any library free. Through these three
lists a librarian can keep in touch with the publications of the most
active publishing department of the government and secure the latest
available information for the library patrons.</p>

<p>The <i>Annual Report</i> of the American Historical Association is devoted
to papers by historians of national fame, to reports of the Public
Archives Commission, and to the publication of historical bibliographical
enterprises. For the students of American history no one set of
government documents can be more valuable. The edition is rather
limited, the law providing for 5,500 copies. As the Smithsonian Institution
has so many exchanges, these reports are best secured from the
quota allowed to Congressmen.</p>

<p>The International Bureau of American Republics is not essentially
a United States government bureau, but one in which twenty-one of
the republics of the Western Hemisphere have an interest. The <i>Monthly
Bulletin</i> is printed in four languages&mdash;English, Spanish, Portuguese and
French. It contains the latest information on the commerce, laws, new
enterprises and general development of each republic. It is essentially
a magazine of Central and South American events. This Bulletin cannot
be obtained free, as the bureau sells nearly all its publications. The
subscription price for the English edition is $2.00 per year. A small
library does not need the foreign edition. Communications should be
addressed to the Director of the Bureau.</p>

<p>No library can afford to be without the publications of the Bureau
of the Census. The volumes of the decennial censuses contain the statistical
records of the nation's growth and development. If the full
set of reports is not wanted, by all means the <i>Abstract</i> should be secured,
as it contains the summaries. The series of <i>Bulletins</i> issued by the permanent
bureau contains the recent statistics, estimates, and are the
source for much of the data found in the annual newspaper almanacs.
These publications are supplied free of charge to libraries upon application
to the Director of the Census or to members of Congress. The
Department of Commerce and Labor has issued a <i>List of Publications</i>
... <i>available for distribution</i>; the Bureau has also issued <i>Publications
Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Censuses and Permanent Bureau</i>. The
publications no longer available are marked with an asterisk.</p>

<p>The <i>Annual Reports</i> of the Civil Service Commission contain the
data on the historical and statistical growth of the classified government
service, the number and character of examinations, the appointments to
service, the rules covering civil service appointment and the legal decisions
of the Commission. The Commission has twenty thousand copies
of its annual report for distribution, applications for it being made directly
to the Commission. The <i>Manual of Examinations</i> is issued
January 1st and July 1st of each year, and give the date, place, character
and scope of scheduled examinations. It will be found indispensable
for those desiring to enter the government service. It will be furnished
gratuitously by the Commission.</p>

<p>The <i>Congressional Directory</i> is issued in three editions for a long
session, and in two for a short one. It contains the essential facts
necessary for a valuable reference book on the government. There are
biographical sketches of each senator, representative and delegate in
Congress; committee arrangements are given for all members; officials
and attaches of both houses are listed; biographical sketches are given
for the heads of the executive departments; there is a roster of the chief
officers in each department and in the consular and diplomatic service;
finally, there is a brief outline of the official duties of each department,
bureau and division in the government. The number issued is determined
by the Joint Committee on Printing, but inasmuch as the <i>Directory</i>
is issued as a Senate document, it can be secured by application to
a member in Congress. If not supplied in this way, it can be purchased
from the Superintendent of Documents. The last edition is the one
to be secured.</p>

<p>The <i>Congressional Record</i> is published daily when Congress is in
session and in a collected edition when the session is over. It is a verbatim
report of all that takes place in Congress, and ought to be placed
with the daily papers in a library. An <i>Index</i> is prepared every two weeks
and one for the entire session. Besides the references to the bills, the
index contains a history of each measure and the number of each committee
report and document presented. Each senator has ninety copies
and each representative and delegate has sixty-two copies. Librarians
should make application to their congressmen for the <i>Record</i> at the beginning
of each session of Congress, as new mailing lists are made out
at that time.</p>

<p>The <i>Annual Reports</i> of the Bureau of Education are devoted to statistics
concerning the educational system of the United States. There
are also discussions and papers on important educational movements
in other countries. The law provides for an edition of 35,000 copies,
20,000 of which are distributed by the Bureau. The reports from 1867
to 1898 are indexed in <i>A. L. A. Index</i>, 2d ed. Since 1906 much of the
descriptive material in the annual reports has been eliminated and published
as <i>Bulletins</i>. These contain many late monographs of importance
and the results of study of new problems in education. Bulletin 2, 1908,
is a <i>List of Publications ... 1867-1907</i>. The annual bibliography
of education which has been issued for the past eight years in the Educational
Review is now printed as a <i>Bulletin</i> of the Bureau of Education.</p>

<p>The <i>Experiment Station Record</i>, a publication of the Office of Experiment
Stations, gives a technical review of the current literature of
agricultural investigation, not only in the United States, but also
throughout the whole world. It reviews books and annual reports of
governments and the agricultural experiment stations in the various
states and about 1,600 periodicals in twelve or more languages. The
Office maintains a mailing list, and application for publications should
be directed to the Director. The <i>Record</i> is also sold by the Superintendent
of Documents at $1.00 per volume, beginning with July, 1909.
Previous volumes are $1.50.</p>

<p>The <i>Annual Reports</i> of the Interstate Commerce Commission cover
both the administrative and the quasi-judicial proceedings of the Commission.
In its administrative features the report presents railroad statistics,
discusses the uniform methods of accounting, and summarizes
the results of enforcing the safety appliance laws, the hours of service
act and the accidents law. Important decisions made during the year
by the Commission and by United States Courts are reviewed. The reports
are furnished gratuitously by the Commission to those who apply.
Another valuable serial is the report on the <i>Statistics of Railways in the
United States</i>. It is prepared according to schedules, and covers the
mileage, the amount of railway capital, the earnings and income, the
general expenditures and the accidents. This volume is also distributed
free by the Commission.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Labor issues three serials which ought to be found
in every library. The <i>Annual Reports</i> contain the results of investigations
which the Bureau has made on industrial and social subjects. The
<i>Special Reports</i> are on particular subjects, and are prepared as requested
by the President of the United States or by either house of Congress.
The <i>Bulletin</i> is issued bi-monthly, and contains the latest information
on subjects within the wide field of labor and not included in the other
reports. The <i>Annual Reports</i> and <i>Bulletins</i> up to 1898 are indexed in
the <i>A. L. A. Index</i>, 2d ed. The Bureau issued an <i>Index</i> in 1902 which
covers <i>Annual Reports</i> 1-16, <i>Bulletins</i> 1-39 and <i>Special Reports</i> 1-9.
Application for these publications are best made to the Bureau and
handled from its mailing list.</p>

<p>The most useful publication of the Library of Congress in a small
library is the series of bibliographies compiled in the Division of Bibliography.
They vary in size from approximately complete bibliographies
to small reading lists on questions of current interest. Inasmuch as
they are based on the largest collection of library materials in the
United States, the bibliographies give an idea of existing references
and sources which might not be suggested or even known in smaller
institutions. Through library loans and the judicious writing for
sources, the small library can supply liberal materials for study from
these bibliographies. As to the distribution of these publications, the
Library of Congress makes this statement: "With certain exceptions,
the publications are not distributed gratis, except to institutions with
which the library regularly exchanges." At any event, they can be purchased
from the Superintendent of Documents for from ten to fifteen
cents. The complete list of these bibliographies is published in the
<i>List of Publications Issued Since 1897</i> (by the Library of Congress).</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Consular and Trade Reports</i> are issued from the Bureau
of Manufactures. These are a collection of reports made by United
States consuls in all parts of the world on matters of commercial and
current importance, such as new inventions, crops, market possibilities
and commercial relations in general. The Bureau will add a library to
its mailing list upon application.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Statistics of the Department of Commerce and
Labor issue two serials which are of use in small libraries. The <i>Monthly
Summary of Commerce and Finance</i> is the leading statistical publication
of the government. It gives a very complete and detailed statistical
account of the foreign commerce of the United States, the internal commerce
and the commerce with the non-contiguous possessions. The
<i>Statistical Abstract</i> covers, in summarized form, most of the important
subjects in the wide field of government activity, and easily ranks as
"the most useful summary of statistics relating to our country that is
printed." The edition is limited to twelve thousand copies&mdash;three
thousand to the Senate, six thousand to the House, and the remainder
to the Bureau. Application for both serials can be made directly to the
Bureau, and especially for the <i>Monthly Summary</i>.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the librarian that intends to be alive to his opportunity
with government documents will get the <i>Annual Reports</i> of the
Superintendent of Documents for 1907 and 1908 and commit them to
heart. They contain the best explanation of the present plan of distribution
and other problems with these publications that has been
written. The library should receive the series of <i>Price Lists</i> and <i>Leaflets</i>
now being issued by the Documents Office. The one is virtually a bibliography
of some important subjects which the documents cover; the
other is a description of some one document or some class of more than
passing interest. Both show what can be purchased and the price of
the publication. If the library has not received copies of <i>Free Lists
Nos. 1 to 3</i>, they should be sent for. They contain a list of the documents
which are offered free of all charge to libraries. Many rare and
useful publications can be secured in this way. Finally, if possible,
subscribe for the <i>Monthly Catalog of Public Documents</i>, which keeps the
reading public informed as to what is now being published by the government,
how and where the publications can be obtained and the
purchase price.</p>

<p>Such are a few suggestions concerning important government serials
in the small libraries. No account has been taken of single documents,
of which a long list can be made. Nor have such problems as shelving,
classifying and cataloging the documents been discussed. The endeavor
has been to show what such a list of documents offers by way of additional
reference source material and how it may be secured. Documents
must not be despised because they are free. They are to be regarded
with honor even in their own country.</p>
